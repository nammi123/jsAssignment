# Dynamic Chart

This is a simple web application that allows users to interactively visualize data. The application uses the Chart.js library to create a line chart. The data is represented as a JSON object. The application uses the Anime.js library to create animations.

First, we create an HTML file with one div inside this div we use using canvas tag for designing.
After that,  we applied CSS for chart height and width and now the chart.js library to create this chart, and for animation, we are using the anime.js library.
